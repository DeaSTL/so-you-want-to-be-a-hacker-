# Adversarial AI

## Machine Learning

- Computers are getting kinda smart
- they can identify patterns and make predictions
- this requires training
- in use daily to stop spam, recommend products and prevent accidents

## Poisoning training data

- bad code in Github Repos
- confuse the AI
- send the model modified data that will cause incorrect behavior
- AI chatbot changed to train on 4chan for example, will become a problem rapidly

## Evasion attacks

- AI is only as good as training
- AI that recognizes spam can be fooled
- if it uses real world info, it can easily release sensitive data...keep an eye on some modes to find sensitive data btw

## Securing learning algorithms

- check the training data
- constantly retrain new data
- train with possible poisoning
