# Ransomware and Crypto-malware

## date is precious

- Organization data like pii or finances

## Ransomware

- we want your coin
- we are going to keep your computer until you pay us
- could be fake, the "police" have seized your computer
- ransom can be removed, don't worry

## Crypto-malware

- new-gen Ransomware
- data is gone until we get paid
- your data files become encrypted
- Ya gotta pay to get your data back.

## Ok, let's avoid this

- always have a data backup: Ideally offline
- keep the OS up to date
- keep apps up to date
- keep anti-virus up to date
- Actually, let's just keep everything up to date. Let microsoft keep installing their spyware every week
