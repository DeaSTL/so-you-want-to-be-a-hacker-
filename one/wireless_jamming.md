# Wireless Jamming

## Radio Frequency Jamming

- Denial of Service: prevent wireless communication
- may not be intentional
- unless it is intentional and someone does not want the network to work

## Wireless Jamming

- many types: constant, random bits / Constant, legitimate frames
- data sent at random times
- reactive jamming: only when someone tries to communicate
- needs to be close
- you can find the jam with a directional atennae, attenuator
- *note* Do not attempt this  attack, you will be caught
