## Tailgating

- use an authorized person to gain access to a building
- follow someone when they open a door
- throw on a high vis vest and follow a construction worker into a site
- wear similar clothing to the office workers and blend into
- see if someone will let you i because you "forgot your keys" -- do this with some pretexting

## Watching for Tailgating

- have a policy for visitors
- one scan, one person; NO MATTER WHAT
- do not be afraid to ask people who tf they are

## Invoice scams

- start with spear phishing
- send a fake Invoice
- accounting pays the Invoice
- may also include a payment link

## Credential Harvesting

- also called password Harvesting
- there are too many stored credentials on your equipment; Chrome, outlook, credential managers....
- user receives a malicious email with a doc that runs a macro to steal these creds
- You will have no idea, it happens in the background

## Effective Social Engineering

- constantly change your tactics
- may involve several people
- may be in person or electronic

## Social Engineering Principles

- Authority: I am in charge
- intimidation: I am the king of the mountain, I will end your career unless...
- Consensus / social proof: Everyone knows who I am
- Scarcity: So, this is the last discount code that I have to offer
- Urgency: Flash Savings! buy now
- Familiarity: Hey, aren't you my son's football coach?
- Trust: You can trust me, I am the SME
