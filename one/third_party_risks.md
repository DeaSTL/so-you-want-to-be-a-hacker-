- human error is still the biggest issue
- all security is important

## System Integration Risks

- Professional installation and maintenance

- vendors are the only ones who can fix their products

## Supply chain risks

- you can't always control security at a third-party location
- hardware and software from a vendor can contain malware
- counterfeit hardware is out there

## Outsourced code development

- accessing the cloud base
  - internal access over a VPN
  - cloud-based access
- verify security to other systems
