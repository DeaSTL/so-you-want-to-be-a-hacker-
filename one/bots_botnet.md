# bots

- when machine is infected, it becomes a bot/zombie
- how did we come to this? you installed a trojan horse or clicked an ad or had another windows vulnerability(noticing anything?)
- a bots life: I sit around and check in with command and control sometimes. I wait for a job to do.

# botnets

- a group of bots working together for the common ungood
- Commonly used in Distributed Denial of Service(DDOS)
- relay spam, proxy net, distributed computing
- crypto mining
  botnets are for sale or rent btw. Not a good long term investment

## Stopping the bot

- Just don't get infected. Use anti-virus and apply patches to OS and apps
- Identify an existing infection: on demand scans, network monitor
- prevent C&C Command and Control
- block at firewall
- identify workstation with a host-based firewall or IPS
