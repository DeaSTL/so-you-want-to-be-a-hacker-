# Vulnerability types

## Zero day attacks

- Many applications have unknown vulnerabilities
- people will eventually uncover them, when they do it is called a zero-day
- attackers like to keep these exploits to themselves
- zero-day definition
  - the vulnerability has not been yet detected or discovered
  - they are increasingly common
- [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](http://cve/mitre.org/)

## Open Permissions

- very easy to leave a door open
- increasingly common with cloud storage

## Unsecured root accounts

- the Linux root account
- can be an accidental or intentional misconfiguration
- disabled direct login to the root account
- protect accounts with  root or admin access

## Errors

- Error messages can provide useful information to an attacker

## Weak Encryption

- encryption protocol(AES, 3DES)
  - Length of the encryption key ( 40 bits, 128 bits, 256 bits )
  - hash used for the integrity check (SHA, MD5)
  - wireless encryption(WEP, WPA)
- some cipher suites are easier to break than others
- TLS is one of the most common issues
- which are good and bad?
  - weak or null hashes(less than 128 bit key sizes)
  - outdated hashes

## Insecure Protocols

- some protocols aren't encrypted
  - Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP

## Default settings

- every application and network device has a default login
- mirai botnet
  - takes advantage of Internet of Thing(IoT)
  - 60+ default configs
  - cameras, routers, doorbells, etc
- mirai released as open source software

## Open ports and services

- services will open ports
- often managed with a firewall
- firewall rulesets can be complex
- always test and audit

## Improper Patch Management

- often centrally managed
- firmware - the bios
- operating system
- applications

## Legacy Platforms

- some devices remain installed for a long time
- legacy devices
  - older operating systems, applications, middleware
- may be running end-of-life software
- may require additional security protections
