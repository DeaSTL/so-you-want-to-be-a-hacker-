# Supply Chain

- contains alot of moving parts
- attackers can infect any step along the way
- one exploit can even affect the entire train

## Supply chain security

- can you actually trust your new server/router/switch/firewall/software/computer?
- use a small supplier base - tight control of vendors
- strict control over policies and procedures - ensure security is in place
- security should be part of the overall design
