# Denial of Service (DOS)

- Force a service to fail
- take advantage of a design flaw or vulnerability
- cause a system to become unavailable
- can be a smokescreen for another attack
- could just turn off the power

## Unintentional DOS

- a DOS can be an accident
- network DoS - layer 2 loop without STP
- bandwidth DOS - downloading a giant file over command line
- physical facility failure

## Distributed Denial of Service(DDOS)

- launch a bot net to bring down a service
- asymmetric threat, the attacker may not have much for resources

## DDOS amplification

- turn a small attack into a major attack
- turn ISP against the victim
- protocols with little authentication checks
  - NTP, DNS, ICMP

## Application DOS

- make an application break of work harder
- fill the disk space
  - zip bomb it
- overuse a measured cloud resources
- increase cloud server response time

## Operational Technology DoS

- The Hardware and software for systems
- more than a web server
  - power grids
  - hvac
  - plants
- a very very serious DoS attack
