# RFID Radio Frequency Identification

- it is in everything
- uses radar technology

## RFID Attacks

- Data capture
- Spoof the reader
- Denial of Service
- decrypt the communication

# Near Field Communication(NFC)

- two way wireless communication: builds on RFID
- in payment systems
- bootstrap for other communication, NFC helps with bluetooth pairing
- in access tokens

## NFC Security Concern

- remote capture
- 10 meters for active devices
- frequency jamming(DOS)
- relay/replay attack
- loss of device
