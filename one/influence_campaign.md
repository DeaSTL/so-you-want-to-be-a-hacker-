# Influence Campaigns

## Hack Public Opinion

- think election times
- sway public opinion on political and social issues
- Nation State Actors typically are behind this
- enabled and amplified by social media
- noteworthy, the majority of religious facebook pages are not sanctioned by religions but are rather Russian backed. Exploiting your victim's religious beliefs and imbedding it with your influence is relatively easy, try to not publicly expose anything.

## Hybrid Warfare

- military strategy
- it's a tale as old as time, the internet makes it 10x easier
- cyberwarfare is an attack on an enemy with technology
- influence with military spin; almost all global elections are under attack by Nation State Actors
