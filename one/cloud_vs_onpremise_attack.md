# Cloud based vs. On-Premise attack

- Two categories for security
- Cloud based security is centralized and costs less: no dedicated hardware, third party handlers
- On-Premise puts the burden of security on the client: incurs data center and infrastructure costs
- Attackers, do not care. They want in.

## On - Premise Security

- Custom Security Posture: Full control over your house
- On Site IT manages security better
- local team maintains uptime and availability
- security changes take time

## Security in the Cloud

- Data is in a secure environment: no physical access, third-party only
- The provider manages large-scale security
- limited downtime 24/7/365 monitoring
  -Scalable security options
