# Shoulder Surfing

- You have access to info that people want to see
- they may be curious, spies or competitors
- this is too easy to do in public settings
- it can even be done with access to webcam or with binos
- the more crowded it is, the easier it is to do. So if you work at a coffee shop, it better be in a small town.

## Prevent this

- Control your input
- social and situational awareness. Be on the lookout for ops
- use privacy filters and screens (these come with some laptops)
- keep your monitor out of view
- DO NOT SIT NEAR ME ;)
