# Physical Attacks

## Malicious USB Cable

- looks normal, trust us....it is normal: It just has extra electronics inside
- OS identifies it as a HID(Human Interface device): It thinks its a keyboard
- it doesnt need extra rights
- it executes commands and downloads stuff once plugged in
- don't plug weird USBs in, just don't do it

## Malicious flash drive

- Don't plug this in either
- some Operating systems will automatically run files, particularly older ones
- could still be HID
- attackers can load malware in documents
- can be a boot device to infect computer on reboot
- could act as an ethernet connector to jump on malicious network
- please don't plug it in

## Skimming

- stealing credit card info
- copy data from magnetic stripe
- ATM skimming: a small camera that also watches for a pin
- now we have your card info
- always check before using card readers

## card cloning

- get details from a skimmer
- create a duplicate of the card
- can only be used with mag stripe, chip cant be cloned
- cloning gift cards is common
