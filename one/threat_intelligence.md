# Threat Intelligence

- Research the Threats and Actors
- data is everywhere
  - Hacker group profiles, tools, social media and more
- make decisions based on intelligence
- Used by researchers, Security ops, etc...

## Open Source Intelligence(OSINT)

- Open-Source
  - publicly available
  - a good place to start
- Internet
  - Discussion groups, social media
- government data
- commercial data

## closed/propietary intelligence

- Someone else has already compiled the info, you can buy it
- Threat intelligence Services
- Constant threat monitoring

## vulnerability databases

- Researchers find vulnerabilities
- common vulnerabilities and exposures(CVE)
  - community managed list of vulnerabilities
  - Sponsored by the US Dept of Homeland Security and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
- U.S. National Vulnerability Database(NVD)
  - A summary of CVEs
  - also sponsored by DHS and CISA
- NVD provides additional details over the SVE list

## public/private information-sharing centers

- public threat intelligence often classified
- private threat intelligence
- need to share critical security details
- Cyber Threat Alliance(CTA)

## Automated indicator sharing(AIS)

- intelligence industry needs a standard way to share important threat date
- Structures Threat information eXpression(StIX)
- trusted Automated eXchange of indicator information(TAXII)

## Dark web intelligence

- Dark Web
  - overlay networks that use the Internet
  - requires specific software and configuration to access
- hacking groups and services
  - activities
  - tools and techniques
  - credit card sales
  - accounts and passwords
- monitor forums for activity
  - company names and executive names

## Indicators of Compromise(IOC)

- an event that indicates an intrusion
  - confidence is high
  - he's calling from inside the house
- Indicators
  - unusual amount of network activity
  - change to file hash values
  - irregular international traffic
  - changes to DNS data
  - uncommon login patterns
  - spikes of read requests from certain files

## Predictive analysis

- analyze large amounts of data very quickly for patterns
- identify behaviors
- create a forecast for potential attacks
- often combined with machine learning

## Threat Maps

- identify attacks and trends
- created from real attack data

## file/code repositories

- see what gigaChads are building on github
- see what code people accidentally release
- attackers are always looking for this code
